# Syllabus

This is the syllabus for the Spring 2018 **Stable Isotope Fractionation** class at the University of Colorado Boulder.

- **Course**: Stable isotope fractionation in biogeochemical processes (Spring 2018, GEOL 5700-002)
- **Instructor**: Sebastian Kopf ([sebastian.kopf@colorado.edu](mailto:sebastian.kopf@colorado.edu))
- **Office hours**: [by appointment](mailto:sebastian.kopf@colorado.edu)
- **Prerequisites**: CHEM 1113/1114, CHEM 1251/1271 or equivalent

## What is this course about?

Where do isotope effects in biogeochemical transformations come from? How are they expressed and preserved in the environment? What can (and can’t) they tell us about the processes, environments and organisms producing them? This graduate-level course will investigate the origins of stable isotope fractionation in geochemical systems with special emphasis on the role of biological catalysts as key drivers of isotopic effects during biogeochemical transformations.  The class will cover general background, theory and practical approaches relevant to understanding and working with isotopic effects in the first half of the semester, and focus on detailed examination of student-selected case studies in the second half of the semester through a guided close reading of the primary literature, in-class discussions, and modeling approaches.

## Learning Goals

The goal of this course is that by the end of the semester, students will be

1. Familiar with basic concepts of stable isotope fractionation in biogeochemical systems (partition functions, diffusional, enzymatic and equilibrium isotope effects, open and closed system behavior, Rayleigh distillation, isotope reaction networks, enzymatic catalysis, physiological drivers, etc.)
2. Aware of key biological isotope systems that play a role in modern and ancient Earth systems.
3. Comfortable reading, critically evaluating and discussing primary literature on biological isotope effects.
4. Confident working with isotope notation, calculating isotopic effects and developing basic models for biological isotope systems in R/RMarkdown

## Prerequisites

1. All students are expected to have taken and be familiar with college-level basic chemistry concepts and notation, algebra and introductory calculus. Please contact the instructor if you do not have prior experience with these topics to arrange for help getting up to speed.
2. No prior background in biology is required.
3. No prior background in the use of computational tools is required

## Logistics

The course logistics including materials, readings and assignments are available at [2018-Stable-Isotope-Fractionation.github.io/schedule](https://2018-Stable-Isotope-Fractionation.github.io/schedule). Note that the logistics page will be updated continuously. Please check the above link for updates and new information throughout the semester.

## Evaluation

Evaluation in this course will be based on homework assignment (beginning of semester), student-led presentations and modeling exercises (second half of semester), and participation in class throughout the course. There are no exams.

### Homework: 30%

Home work during the first part of the semester will provide exercises to become more comfortable with GitHub, R, and with typical isotope calculations and to deepen students’ understanding of basic isotope concepts covered in class. The assignments are designed to help prepare students for their own presentation and development of a model exploring their isotope system of choice.

### Leading discussion / presentation: 25%

At the beginning of the semester, each student will choose an isotopic effect in a system of interest or from a list of topics provided by the instructor (examples include the various forms of carbon fixation, e.g. C3 vs. C4 photosynthesis; oxygen respiration; denitrification; nitrogen fixation; lipid biosynthesis; sulfate reduction; biomineralization; methanogenesis, etc.). Each student will work with the instructor to select 1 (max 2) papers describing their system from the primary literature (for the whole class to read), prepare and present their topic to the class and lead the discussion of the selected readings. Depending on the topic, the instructor will provide broader context for system the week prior to the student’s presentation.

### Modeling / in-class exercise: 25%

Each student will develop a basic model in R for their isotope system to illustrate how the key variables may change observed isotope signatures, and guide an in-class exercise to explore their model together with everyone in the class. The instructor will lead similar exercises at the beginning of the semester to demonstrate the approach and will assist individual students with this assignment as needed.

### Participation: 20%

The whole class and especially the second half of the semester will include critical reading of primary literature (typically 1 paper/week), discussion of papers, participation in in-class programming exercises, and providing constructive feedback for each other. Consequently, all students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the material and participate actively in discussions and exercises.

### Late Work Policy

Since many class exercises and student projects will depend on the whole class coming prepared, everyone is responsible for handing in work on time. Work that is turned in one day late (i.e. within 24 hours after the deadline) will be marked down by 25%. Work turned in up to a week late will be marked down by 50% but you must let me know when to expect your work or I will reserve the right to deduct points. If you are having trouble with an assignment, please talk with me ahead of time. No late work will be accepted more than a week after an assignment deadline or after the last day of classes.


## Academic Climate

It is expected that everyone be respectful to their fellow classmates and professor. This includes interactions in class, during work outside of class, and for postings online. In an effort to create a positive atmosphere for learning and teamwork within the classroom, it is requested that you do not use your cell phone during class; limit use of your laptop computer to class purposes; and provide at least 24 hours of advance notice if you will be late or absent from class.

## Academic Integrity

You are expected to abide by the [CU Boulder honor code](http://honorcode.colorado.edu). Present your own work. You are free (and encouraged) to consult with classmates for thoughts and feedback on your topic, presentation and model. You are expected to try to solve the homework assignments on your own but if you get stuck, it is okay to consult with your class mates and try to solve a problem together as long as a) you indicate on your homework assignment who you worked with and b) you explain concepts to each. When researching your topic, consult the primary literature and include appropriate source attribution in the materials you present in class.

## Special Accommodations

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please let your professor know as soon as possible so that your needs can be addressed. The University [Disability Services](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/) determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by email at [dsinfo@colorado.edu](mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu). If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries guidelines under the Quick Links at the [Disability Services](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/) website and discuss your needs with your professor. Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. You must inform your professor [by email](mailto:sebastian.kopf@colorado.edu) as early as possible in the semester (at least 1 week before any scheduled exams or assignments) about any religious observance conflicts.
